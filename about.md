My name is Prashant Lakhlani and I'm a programmer by profession. I love reading books, playing many sports (which I'm not doing since many years), playing flute and guitar, a movie lover. I'm good listener, patient and love to experiment.

## An Experimentor
I've blogged earlier between 2007 - 2018 and the blog posts can be found [here](http://lakhlaniprashant.blogspot.com/). Most of the blog posts there are related to dotnetnuke. 

An Experimentor is started to continue the journey of experimenting and sharing the knowledge and contribute back a little bit to the open source community that I am obligated to.

## Technology Geek
I'm an enthusiastic technology geek who loves to develop modern and innovative software for businesses. I'm having 15 years of real-life experience building software for many industries.

I'm an expert developer and work with Microsoft SharePoint (2010/2013/2016/2019/Online), .Net (Framework 1.1, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0), and .Net Core with C# and VB.NET. I am also good with React, Angular, and Typescript. I use Boostrap and material-ui for reactjs for the design system and have a good basic understanding to develop presentable styling.

I'm passionate about solving business problems using technology and developed good proficiency in delivering innovative business solutions. 

So, I converted that passion and talent into the business. I run an award-winning company 🏆 [Facile Technolab Pvt. Ltd](https://www.faciletechnolab.com) where we focus on helping businesses who need custom software development to achieve:
👉 Modernize legacy applications to modern 🌈, cloud-based apps
👉 Migrating business application to Cloud
👉 Convert their business software to SaaS
👉 Convert an Idea into MVP

In 2020, we received three major recognizations:

1. 🏆 [Top offshore software development companies 2020](https://autos.yahoo.com/top-offshore-software-development-companies-081500977.html)
