My weekly journal is series of blog posts where I share stories about my professional and personal work. This is my weekly Journal 01, Jan 16, 2021 and in this post I am going to share with you about:

1. I started my Blog - Experimentor
2. I started using Notion (Thanks to James Tononcelli)
3. I opted for Goodreads.com reading challenge
4. I read Ikigai: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life 

### I started my Blog - Experimentor
I used to blog regularly till beginning of 2018. Since middle of 2018, things go crazy with my personal and professional life and I didn't get enough time to blog about any of my topics.

I came across the blog post from [Gurucharan Subramani](https://www.gurucharan.in/blog/blogging-as-a-developer/) that I bookmarked in Sep 2020 to come back. 

Before couple of weeks, I started educating myself and this week I was able to actually finish setting up my blog and this is my first blog post.

### I started using Notion (Thanks to James Tononcelli)
I came across Notion in early 2020 last year when one of the client on-boarded me to work on his project on Notion. It was a little surprising as most of the time it's Jira, Asana, Trello, TargetProcess or some other popular tools for project management. 

I wanted to browse through more and find out how we can use this free tool Notion more to be personally more managed and be on top of my goals, tasks, priorities etc.

During one of our standups last week, James Tononcelli shown me his awesome Notion for Desktop and how he is managing himself there and it helped me be sure about setting up Notion for my personal use too.

Try out some of the many useful Notional templates to get started and read through some interested examples about personal productivity with Notion.

### I opted for Goodreads.com reading challenge 
This year, I've opted for Goodreads.com reading challenge 2021 and will be reading 20 books this year.

In 2017, I took challenge to read 10 books and I missed the challenge and ended up most of my books unfinished. Here is the [full list of books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/8895320) I attempted.

In 2018, I took challenge to read 9 books and I was close and finished 8 complete books. Here is the [full list of books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10652962) I read.

In 2019, I took challenge to read 10 books and I was close again as I finished 8 of them. Here is the [full list of books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/15880605) I read.

This year, I will be reading 20 books and you can [see them all here](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/27191844)

**What are you reading this year?**

### I read Ikigai: The Japanese secret to a long and happy life 

This was the first book of 20 that I am going to read as part of my [reading challenge 2021](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/27191844).

Too lazy to read this book? [Here is the useful summary of the book](https://www.sloww.co/ikigai-book/)
